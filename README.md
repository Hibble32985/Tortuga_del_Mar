# Tortuga_del_Mar_Challenge_3
This is an application that can be usde to generate a random password based on previously selected characters. It will run in the browser of choice and have an interface that's responsive and adaptable to multiple screen sizes.
When the appropriate button is clicked to generate a password prompts for password criteria are presented.  One can state the criteria to include in the password.  These prompts will consist of what length the password should be (a minimum of 8 characters and a  maximum of 128), character types (whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric and/or special characters). When each of these prompts are answered, the input will be validated and a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.  Once the password is generated the password will either be displayed in an alert or written on the page.
